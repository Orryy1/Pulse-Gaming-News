## Frame 1 - More scene light than screen light

- scene: A tall SCENE LIGHT range rises beyond a shorter DISPLAY LIMIT range on the same luminance ruler.

- focal: SCENE LIGHT extending beyond DISPLAY LIMIT
- roles: luminance ranges = foreground proof, upper highlight marker = supporting, dark scale field = background
- sfx: none
- diagram_source: Original input-to-output range comparison based on Microsoft's HDR tone-map effect description of adapting image dynamic range to output-display capability: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct2d/hdr-tone-map-effect

Adapt: retain the centered type-beat contrast, but make two luminance ranges the statement's visible proof.

Scene 1 (0.0-2.7s): In the upper 83%, DISPLAY LIMIT rises to a fixed ceiling by SVG self-draw (`svg-path-draw`) on a power3 long-tail settle.

Scene 2 (2.7-5.9s): On "brighter highlights", SCENE LIGHT extends above that ceiling through bars and progress fill (`stat-bars-and-fills`) with one fire-orange highlight marker.

Scene 3 (5.9-8.7s): MORE SCENE LIGHT THAN SCREEN LIGHT reveals via per-word staggered reveal (`dynamic-content-sequencing`), then the two ranges reach a static hold (`gsap-effects`).

narrativeRole: Shows why an HDR renderer still encounters a real output limit.
keyMessage: Scene luminance can exceed what one display can reproduce at once.

# Dynamic Content Sequencing

A utility pattern (not a motion rule in itself) for scenes that show a SEQUENCE of items (cards, phrases, stats): each item's duration is computed from its content length + per-item config, and the sequencer assigns absolute start/end times automatically — no hardcoded offsets per item. Distinct from [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md) (one text element changing states) — this rule swaps between distinct content blocks.

## How It Works

A content array of `{ eyebrow, title, body, speedFactor, hold }` entries is reduced once at build time into a flat `TIMELINE` of `{ …entry, start, end }` — duration per entry is `BASE_DURATION + body.length × SEC_PER_CHAR + hold`, so longer text earns more reading time. A single linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches the active entry and swaps the DOM **only on transitions** (a `lastTitle` guard — per-frame `textContent` writes flicker in render); an optional progress bar fills 0→100% across the whole run.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="display">
  <div class="eyebrow" id="eyebrow"></div>
  <div class="title" id="title"></div>
  <div class="body" id="body"></div>
  <div class="progress-bar"><div class="progress-fill" id="progress-fill"></div></div>
</div>
```

```css
.body {
  min-height: 160px; /* reserve space — content height varies; without this, layout jumps */
}
.progress-fill {
  height: 100%;
  width: 0%;
}
```

```js
// N entries, each with its own pacing (optionally a speedFactor multiplier);
// the final entry uses a larger hold (closing beat).
const CONTENT = [
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrow1}", title: "{title1}", body: "{body1}", hold: HOLD_MID },
  // …
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrowN}", title: "{titleN}", body: "{bodyN}", hold: HOLD_FINAL },
];

// Pre-compute absolute start/end ONCE — never in onUpdate.
let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry) => {
  const dur = BASE_DURATION + entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR + entry.hold;
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});

function entryAt(time) {
  for (let i = TIMELINE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= TIMELINE[i].start) return TIMELINE[i];
  }
  return TIMELINE[0];
}

const eyebrowEl = document.getElementById("eyebrow");
const titleEl = document.getElementById("title");
const bodyEl = document.getElementById("body");
const progressEl = document.getElementById("progress-fill");

const TOTAL_DURATION = cumulative + TAIL_PAD;
const driver = { t: 0 };
let lastTitle = "";

tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const entry = entryAt(driver.t);
      // Swap content only on transitions — no per-frame DOM thrash
      if (entry.title !== lastTitle) {
        eyebrowEl.textContent = entry.eyebrow;
        titleEl.textContent = entry.title;
        bodyEl.textContent = entry.body;
        lastTitle = entry.title;
      }
      progressEl.style.width = `${(driver.t / TOTAL_DURATION) * 100}%`;
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Crossfade between items** — return BOTH adjacent entries during an overlap window (`time ≥ e.start − overlap && time ≤ e.end + overlap`, overlap ≈ 0.3s) and render them with opacities computed from distance to the boundary.
- **Per-item motion variation** — map an `entry.style` key to an existing rule per chapter (e.g. `3d-text-depth-layers` → `hacker-flip-3d` → `counting-dynamic-scale`); the sequencer only orchestrates timing.
- **Auto-extend composition duration** — you can set `data-duration` from the computed `TOTAL_DURATION` in script, but HF reads `data-duration` at composition load and setting it after init may not take effect — author the duration manually from a rough total.

### Accelerating cadence (geometric hold decay)

For rhetorical escalation — "everyone says…", a roll-call, a praise flurry — the beat grid itself accelerates: early entries hold ~1s (read speed), then windows shrink geometrically into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry, braking on an emphasis state before the resolve. The acceleration is pre-computed into the same flat `TIMELINE` — still content-driven, still deterministic, no speed-up tween anywhere:

```js
// Geometric decay on the hold, clamped at a flurry floor; the brake state holds longest.
const HOLDS = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => Math.max(FLURRY_FLOOR, HOLD_START * Math.pow(DECAY, i)));
HOLDS[CONTENT.length - 1] = HOLD_FINAL;

let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => {
  // Past ~0.5s states are glanced as motion texture, not read —
  // drop the per-char term or you never reach flurry speed.
  const readable = HOLDS[i] >= READ_THRESHOLD;
  const dur = HOLDS[i] + (readable ? entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR : 0);
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});
```

Worked example — **praise-chip flurry**: ~16 short quotes hard-cut through a chip beside a pinned wordmark. First 3 states at `HOLD_START = 1.0` (each reads fully); `DECAY = 0.8` shrinks every following window until `FLURRY_FLOOR = 0.2` catches it (≈12 states over ~2.5s — a churn of acclaim, individually glanced); the longest phrase takes `HOLD_FINAL ≈ 1.6` as the brake before the closing lockup.

Values: `HOLD_START` 0.8–1.2s; `DECAY` 0.75–0.88 (higher = longer runway before the flurry bites); `FLURRY_FLOOR` 0.15–0.3s (below ~0.15s swaps strobe); `READ_THRESHOLD` ~0.5s; brake ≥ 4× the floor or the stop doesn't register as a beat. The 3–6 entry guidance relaxes here — 12–18 states are legal precisely because flurry states aren't individually read. The hard-cut discipline (`lastTitle` guard, instant swaps) is what lets 0.2s states render clean.

## Critical Constraints

- **Pre-compute the TIMELINE once at build** — never recompute in `onUpdate`; the reverse search over the flat array is the whole per-frame cost.
- **DOM swap only on entry transition** (`lastTitle`/key guard) — per-frame `textContent` assignment flickers in HF render.
- **`min-height` on the body element** — without reservation, downstream elements (progress bar, brand) jitter as content height varies.
- **Sequential only** — for parallel tracks use a different reduction.
- **Titles fit one line at the chosen size; bodies fit inside `min-height` after wrapping.**

## Selected motion rule: gsap-effects

# GSAP Effects for HyperFrames

Drop-in animation patterns. Snippets show mechanism only, inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core); assume `tl` exists.

- [Typewriter](#typewriter) — character-by-character reveal with optional cursor / backspace / word rotation
- [Audio Visualizer](#audio-visualizer) — pre-extract audio data, drive Canvas/DOM rendering from the timeline

## Typewriter

Requires GSAP's TextPlugin alongside the core script:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3.14.2/dist/TextPlugin.min.js"></script>
<script>
  gsap.registerPlugin(TextPlugin);
</script>
```

### Basic

```js
const text = "Hello, world!";
const cps = 10; // chars per second — see timing table
tl.to(
  "#typed-text",
  { text: { value: text }, duration: text.length / cps, ease: "none" },
  startTime,
);
```

### Blinking Cursor

Three rules: **one cursor visible at a time** (hide previous before showing next); **cursor must blink when idle** (after typing, during holds); **no gap between text and cursor** (elements flush in HTML).

```html
<span id="typed-text"></span><span id="cursor" class="cursor-blink">|</span>
```

```css
@keyframes blink {
  0%,
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
  }
  50% {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}
.cursor-blink {
  animation: blink 0.8s step-end infinite;
}
.cursor-solid {
  animation: none;
  opacity: 1;
}
.cursor-hide {
  animation: none;
  opacity: 0;
}
```

Pattern: blink → solid (typing starts) → type → blink (typing done):

```js
tl.call(() => cursor.classList.replace("cursor-blink", "cursor-solid"), [], startTime);
tl.to("#typed-text", { text: { value: text }, duration: dur, ease: "none" }, startTime);
tl.call(() => cursor.classList.replace("cursor-solid", "cursor-blink"), [], startTime + dur);
```

Multi-line handoff: hide previous cursor → blink new → brief pause (~0.5s) → solid when typing. Never go `hidden → solid` (skips the idle blink).

### Backspacing

TextPlugin removes from the front — wrong for backspace. Use manual substring removal:

```js
function backspace(tl, selector, word, startTime, cps) {
  const el = document.querySelector(selector);
  const interval = 1 / cps;
  for (let i = word.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    tl.call(
      () => (el.textContent = word.slice(0, i)),
      [],
      startTime + (word.length - i) * interval,
    );
  }
  return word.length * interval;
}
```

### Spacing With Static Text

A typewriter word next to static text (`<span>Ship something</span><span style="margin-left:14px"><span id="word"></span><span id="cursor">|</span></span>` in a baseline-aligned flex row): use `margin-left` on the wrapper span. Don't use flex `gap` (it spaces the cursor from the text) and don't put a trailing space in the static text (it collapses when the dynamic span is empty).

### Word Rotation

Type → hold → backspace → next word; cursor blinks during every idle moment:

```js
let offset = 0;
words.forEach((word, i) => {
  const typeDur = word.length / 10;
  // cursor: solid while typing, blink during holds (same call pattern as above)
  tl.to("#typed-text", { text: { value: word }, duration: typeDur, ease: "none" }, offset);
  offset += typeDur + 1.5; // hold
  if (i < words.length - 1) offset += backspace(tl, "#typed-text", word, offset, 20) + 0.3;
});
```

### Appending Words

Build a sentence word-by-word into the same element: keep an `accumulated` string, each step tweens `text: { value: accumulated + " " + word }` with `duration: newChars / cps`, then advances the offset.

### Timing Guide

| CPS   | Feel             | Good for                   |
| ----- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| 3-5   | Slow, deliberate | Dramatic reveals, suspense |
| 8-12  | Natural typing   | Dialogue, narration        |
| 15-20 | Fast, energetic  | Tech demos, code           |
| 30+   | Near-instant     | Filling long blocks        |

## Audio Visualizer

Pre-extract audio data, drive Canvas / DOM rendering from the timeline. **Do not use the Web Audio API at render time** — there's no playback during seek.

### Extract Audio Data

Bundled extractor (requires `ffmpeg` + Python `numpy`):

```bash
python skills/hyperframes-creative/scripts/extract-audio-data.py audio.mp3 -o audio-data.json
python skills/hyperframes-creative/scripts/extract-audio-data.py video.mp4 --fps 30 --bands 16 -o audio-data.json
```

Output: `{ "fps": 30, "totalFrames": 5415, "frames": [{ "time": 0.0, "rms": 0.42, "bands": [0.8, 0.6, 0.3] }] }` — `rms` (0-1) is overall loudness; `bands[]` (0-1) are frequency magnitudes, index 0 = bass, each band normalized independently.

### Loading (Synchronously)

Inline the JSON for small files (< ~500 KB), or sync XHR for large ones:

```js
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("GET", "audio-data.json", false); // synchronous — deliberate
xhr.send();
const AUDIO_DATA = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
```

**Do NOT use async `fetch()`** — HyperFrames reads `window.__timelines` synchronously after page load; building the timeline inside `.then()` means it isn't ready when capture starts.

### Driving the Timeline

Canvas 2D is the workhorse (bars, waveforms, circles, gradients) — one `tl.call` per frame:

```js
const ctx = document.getElementById("viz").getContext("2d");
for (let f = 0; f < AUDIO_DATA.totalFrames; f++) {
  tl.call(
    () => {
      const frame = AUDIO_DATA.frames[f];
      ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
      // draw using frame.rms and frame.bands
    },
    [],
    f / AUDIO_DATA.fps,
  );
}
```

WebGL / Three.js: HyperFrames patches `THREE.Clock` for deterministic time — update uniforms from audio data each frame. DOM elements: fine under ~20 elements, slower than Canvas beyond that.

### Smoothing

```js
let prev = null;
const smoothing = 0.25; // 0.1-0.2 snappy, 0.3-0.5 flowing
function smooth(f) {
  const raw = AUDIO_DATA.frames[f];
  if (!prev) prev = { rms: raw.rms, bands: [...raw.bands] };
  else {
    prev = {
      rms: prev.rms * smoothing + raw.rms * (1 - smoothing),
      bands: raw.bands.map((b, i) => prev.bands[i] * smoothing + b * (1 - smoothing)),
    };
  }
  return prev;
}
```

### Design Guide

- **Spatial mapping** — horizontal: bass left, treble right; vertical: bass bottom; circular: bass at 12 o'clock, wrap clockwise (mirror for a full circle).
- **Bass drives big moves** (scale, glow, position); **treble drives detail** (shimmer, flicker, edges); **RMS drives globals** (background brightness, overall energy).
- Pick 2-3 animated properties — more looks noisy. Keep minimums above zero so quiet sections still have life.
- **Band count**: 4 = background glow/pulse, 8 = bar charts, 16 = detailed EQ (default), 32 = dense radial layouts.
- **Layering**: stack canvases with `z-index` — a background layer driven by bass/rms under a foreground layer driven by individual bands gives depth without per-element complexity.

# Stat Bars & Fills

The graphics that give a stat **visual weight** beside its number: a small bar chart, a progress bar/ring filling to a percentage, or a star row filling to a fractional rating. Pair these with [counting-dynamic-scale.md](counting-dynamic-scale.md) (the number) for a complete stat scene.

**Layout blueprint — pick ONE and hold it across all stats:**

- **Single-focus** — one centered frame, the number is the hero, a ring or bar sits under/around it. Cleanest for a sequential reveal (stat 1 → stat 2 → stat 3 in the same frame).
- **Split-frame** — big number on the left, paired graphic on the right. Better when stats are shown together or each needs a distinct visual.

Don't mix blueprints between stats in one piece — that reads as inconsistent.

## Recipe

### 1 — Growth Bars (CSS `scaleY` stagger)

Bars grow from the baseline with a stagger; the last bar is the accent. Heights are authored in CSS (inline height per bar); GSAP only reveals `scaleY: 0 → 1` — never animate `height`.

```css
.bars {
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-end;
  gap: 14px;
  height: 280px;
}
.bar {
  width: 48px;
  background: #3a4a64;
  transform: scaleY(0);
  transform-origin: bottom center; /* grow UP from the baseline, not from center */
}
.bar:last-child {
  background: #ffc300; /* accent the final/current bar */
}
```

```js
tl.to(".bar", { scaleY: 1, duration: 0.7, ease: "power3.out", stagger: 0.08 }, 0.3);
```

### 2 — Progress Fill

**Bar form** — `scaleX` from a left origin:

```css
.track {
  width: 520px;
  height: 16px;
  background: #1b263b;
  border-radius: 8px;
  overflow: hidden;
}
/* width:100% is REQUIRED — an absolutely-positioned fill with no width is 0px, and scaleX of 0 is
   still 0 → the bar renders invisible (automated gates may miss a zero-width scaled element). */
.fill {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: #ffc300;
  transform: scaleX(0);
  transform-origin: left center;
}
```

```js
const PCT = 0.92; // 92%
tl.to(".fill", { scaleX: PCT, duration: 1.0, ease: "power2.out" }, 0.3);
```

**Ring form** — measured stroke draw (mechanics in [svg-path-draw.md](svg-path-draw.md)):

```js
const ring = document.querySelector("#ring");
const LEN = ring.getTotalLength(); // measure, don't hard-code the circumference
ring.style.strokeDasharray = LEN;
ring.style.strokeDashoffset = LEN; // empty
// rotate the <circle> -90deg in CSS so the fill starts at 12 o'clock
tl.to(ring, { strokeDashoffset: LEN * (1 - 0.92), duration: 1.1, ease: "power2.out" }, 0.3);
```

### 3 — Star-Rating Fill (fractional)

A gold star row revealed left-to-right to a fractional value (e.g. 4.6 / 5) via a clip wipe over a gold layer sitting on a gray layer.

```html
<div class="stars">
  <div class="stars-gray">★★★★★</div>
  <div class="stars-gold" id="goldStars">★★★★★</div>
</div>
```

```css
.stars {
  position: relative;
  font-size: 64px;
  letter-spacing: 8px;
}
.stars-gray {
  color: #2b3548;
}
.stars-gold {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  color: #ffc300;
  width: 100%;
  clip-path: inset(0 100% 0 0);
}
```

```js
const RATING = 4.6,
  MAX = 5;
tl.to(
  "#goldStars",
  { clipPath: `inset(0 ${100 - (RATING / MAX) * 100}% 0 0)`, duration: 1.0, ease: "power2.out" },
  0.3,
);
```

## Values

| ------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bar count     | 4–6         | reads as "a trend" without clutter; the last bar is the current/accent value        |
| fill duration | 0.8–1.2s    | matched to the paired count-up so number and graphic land together (share the ease) |
| stagger       | 0.06–0.1s   | larger feels sluggish, 0 loses the build                                            |
| accent hue    | exactly one | bars/fill/stars all use the same accent, the rest is muted                          |

## Critical Constraints

- **`scaleY` / `scaleX` / `clipPath`, never `height`/`width` tweens** — author each bar's final height in CSS and scale from 0.
- **`transform-origin`** must be `bottom` (bars grow up) / `left` (fills grow right) — the default center origin scales from the middle and looks wrong.
- **`.fill` needs `width: 100%`** — a zero-width fill scaled by any factor is still invisible, and automated gates may miss it.
- **Measure, don't hard-code** — ring length via `getTotalLength()`; a hard-coded circumference breaks if the radius changes.
- **Match the number's timing** — the fill and the count-up peak together (same start + ease) so the stat resolves as one beat, not two; a paired counter's `onUpdate` must be O(1) (see [counting-dynamic-scale.md](counting-dynamic-scale.md)).
- **One accent hue, consistent blueprint** — see `hyperframes-creative/references/data-in-motion.md`.

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

.logo-mark path {

  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,

tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",

  SEG_3_START,

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",

  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

## Values

| token             | range                                   | notes                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.
