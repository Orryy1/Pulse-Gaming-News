## Frame 3 - Missed the gate

- scene: A completed-frame marker arrives just after a boundary and the old image remains visible until the next one.
- voiceover: "Miss that boundary by a fraction and the previous image may remain visible until another refresh opportunity arrives."
- duration: 8.5s
- poster: 6.0s

- status: outline
- src: compositions/frames/03-missed-gate.html
- type: feature_showcase
- persuasion: Counterfactual demonstration
- beat: Tension
- blueprint: fixed-anchor-cycle (Adapt)
- focal: MISSED THE GATE with the previous frame held
- roles: late frame marker = foreground cause, old image = foreground consequence, two refresh gates = supporting
- sfx: none
- diagram_source: Original missed-boundary sequence based on AMD's example where the prior frame is shown for two refresh intervals after a late present: https://gpuopen.com/manuals/fidelityfx_sdk/techniques/frame-interpolation-swap-chain/

Adapt: retain the pinned anchor, using the fixed gate as the unchanged anchor while the late-frame state changes around it.

Scene 1 (0.0-2.7s): In the upper 83%, the fixed refresh gate pins via SVG self-draw (`svg-path-draw`) while the first interval remains empty.

Scene 2 (2.7-5.5s): On "by a fraction", FRAME READY enters by cluster-to-outward expansion (`center-outward-expansion`) after the gate and MISSED THE GATE receives keyword glow (`asr-keyword-glow`).

Scene 3 (5.5-8.5s): On "previous image", the cream old-image card remains; the new card hard-swaps at the next gate (`discrete-text-sequence`) and the result reaches a static hold (`gsap-effects`).

narrativeRole: Makes the extra wait visible without claiming it happens on every frame.
keyMessage: A finished frame that narrowly misses a boundary can wait for another opportunity.

# ASR Keyword Glow

Words in a phrase visually activate (glow blur + scale) when "spoken", following an attack-sustain-release envelope over per-word `{ start, end }` timestamps. In a real ASR pipeline the timings come from a word-level transcript (`hyperframes transcribe` — same shape); for promo video, hand-author them to control emphasis pacing. The envelope never falls to zero after a word — it decays to a rest level, leaving a breadcrumb of recent emphasis.

## How It Works

A single linear driver tween (`ease: "none"` — any other ease distorts the per-word envelope; do not change) sweeps scene time; its `onUpdate` loops over ALL words computing each one's envelope: 0 before `start`, linear attack to 1 over `ATTACK_DUR`, sustain at 1 until `end`, decay to `REST_LEVEL` over `RELEASE`, then hold at rest. The envelope drives `text-shadow` blur and `scale` — one driver for the whole phrase, never one tween per word (60+ words would bloat the timeline).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="phrase">
  <span class="word" data-word="{w1Key}">{w1}</span>
  <span class="word" data-word="{w2Key}">{w2}</span>
  <!-- … the final word may be the brand, with the .brand modifier -->
  <span class="word brand" data-word="{brandKey}">{brandWord}</span>
</div>
```

```css
.phrase {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: center;
  color: {restColor};
}
.word {
  display: inline-block; /* required for transform on <span> */
  transform-origin: 50% 50%;
  text-shadow: 0 0 0 {glowColorTransparent};
}
.word.brand {
  color: {brandAccentColor};
}
```

```js
// Per-word spoken windows — one entry per span; brand word 1.5-2× a normal word's window.
const TIMINGS = {
  // {w1Key}: { start: …, end: … },  — seconds, local to the scene
};

function envelope(time, start, end) {
  if (time < start) return 0;
  if (time < end) return Math.min((time - start) / ATTACK_DUR, 1);
  const releaseEnd = end + RELEASE;
  if (time < releaseEnd) return 1 - ((time - end) / RELEASE) * (1 - REST_LEVEL);
  return REST_LEVEL;
}

const words = document.querySelectorAll(".word");
const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: SCENE_DURATION,
    duration: SCENE_DURATION,
    ease: "none", // linear — t maps 1:1 to scene time
    onUpdate: () => {
      words.forEach((el) => {
        const timing = TIMINGS[el.dataset.word];
        if (!timing) return;
        const env = envelope(driver.t, timing.start, timing.end);
        el.style.textShadow = `0 0 ${MAX_BLUR * env}px ${glowColorRgba(env)}`;
        el.style.transform = `scale(${1 + MAX_SCALE_BOOST * env})`;
      });
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

`glowColorRgba(env)` returns the glow color with `env`-modulated alpha.

## Variations

- **Karaoke style (RECOMMENDED for video narration)** — the default amplitudes read too subtle in video: inactive words still dominate. Render inactive words DIM and lerp the active word toward bright + larger; at any moment 1–2 words are bright (spoken + lingering rest) and the rest is dim. Use for short phrases (5–10 words) where one word at a time should POP; keep the subtle default for long dense text. Pushes MAX_BLUR, MAX_SCALE_BOOST, and REST↔ACTIVE contrast; everything else identical:

```js
function lerpChannel(a, b, t) {
  return Math.round(a + (b - a) * t);
}
function colorAt(env, isBrand) {
  const target = isBrand ? BRAND_RGB : ACTIVE_RGB;
  return `rgb(${lerpChannel(REST_RGB.r, target.r, env)}, ${lerpChannel(REST_RGB.g, target.g, env)}, ${lerpChannel(REST_RGB.b, target.b, env)})`;
}
// in onUpdate: el.style.color = colorAt(env, el.classList.contains("brand"));
```

- **Multi-octave glow** — multiply the sustain by `1 + sin(driver.t × PULSE_HZ) × PULSE_AMPLITUDE` so high-emphasis words breathe at peak.
- **Color shift on the peak** — same channel-lerp from `restColor` → `peakColor` as `env` rises (non-karaoke form).
- **3D pop-out** — add `translateZ(env × MAX_POP_Z)` so the spoken word leans toward camera; requires `perspective` on the parent.
- **From real ASR transcripts** — convert `{ word, start_ms, end_ms }` entries to seconds and feed in identically.

| SCENE_DURATION  | = `data-duration`    | same          | driver must end in sync with the scene's seek window       |

## Critical Constraints

- **Timings monotonic, non-overlapping** — every entry's `end` < the next entry's `start`; overlapping windows make the envelope ambiguous.
- **Brand word window 1.5–2× a normal word** — the brand is the headline; let it sustain.
- **Driver ease stays `"none"`** — any other ease warps every word's envelope timing.
- **`text-shadow`, not `box-shadow`** — the glow must hug the GLYPH (speaking emphasis), not the inline-block rectangle.
- **One driver looping all words** — never one tween per word.
- **Commit to a style** — values between the default and karaoke columns yield awkward "half-loud" emphasis.
- **Climax dwell ≥1s** after the final word's emphasis — the last word IS the headline beat.

## Selected motion rule: center-outward-expansion

description: Elements start clustered at screen center and expand outward to their final positions, driven by a shared progress value.
metadata:
  tags: expansion, scatter, center, reveal, layout, sync, burst

# Center-Outward Expansion

Elements begin at one shared center point and radiate outward to their final positions — the entry beat itself, or motion driven by another animation's progress (a counting number, a beat). Flat 2D cousin of [depth-scatter-assemble.md](depth-scatter-assemble.md) (per-element 3D cloud): here every element shares the SAME origin.

## How It Works

Each element carries its final offset as `data-target-x/y`. Its position lerps between center and target: `x = targetX × progress`. Self-centering is baked as `xPercent/yPercent: -50` so the tweened `x`/`y` are pure offsets from the stage center. Standalone burst = per-item staggered `fromTo`; driven burst = one shared proxy (see Variations).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="burst-wrap">
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="-360" data-target-y="-180">{itemA}</div>
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="360" data-target-y="-180">{itemB}</div>
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="0" data-target-y="360">{itemC}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.burst-wrap {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
.burst-item {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%; /* GSAP xPercent/yPercent -50 bakes the centering; x/y tween the offset */
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
document.querySelectorAll(".burst-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { xPercent: -50, yPercent: -50, x: 0, y: 0, scale: 0.6, opacity: 0 },
    {
      x: Number(el.dataset.targetX),
      y: Number(el.dataset.targetY),
      scale: 1,
      opacity: 1,
      duration: EXPAND_DUR,
      ease: EXPAND_EASE,
    },
    ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Synced to a driver (chord)**: when the burst shadows a counter / beat, drop the stagger and drive all items from ONE 0→1 proxy tween with the driver's exact duration AND ease; `onUpdate` writes `translate(-50%,-50%) translate(targetX*p, targetY*p)` per item — the two read as one beat.
- **Partially-spread start**: with 6+ items the full cluster piles up — start from `{ x: targetX * START_PROGRESS, ... }`.
- **Idle micro-float**: hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) after landing instead of freezing.

| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ITEM_COUNT     | 3–8                  | > 8 = visual chaos mid-expansion; low counts want wider spread   |
| EXPAND_DUR     | 1.0–1.8s             | must equal the driver's duration in the synced variant           |
| EXPAND_EASE    | `power3.out` default | `power2.out` gentler, `expo.out` dramatic stop; NEVER `in` eases |
| STAGGER        | 0.04–0.08s           | tighter = chord; looser = lazy arpeggio                          |
| ENTRY_AT       | 0–0.5s               | a beat of compositional quiet before the burst                   |
| START_PROGRESS | 0–0.5                | 0 = dramatic full cluster; ~0.3 avoids the pile-up               |

## Critical Constraints

- **Tween `x`/`y` over the baked `xPercent/yPercent: -50`** — mutating `left`/`top` fights the centering and causes pixel jitter.
- **Out-easing only** — `in` easings read as items being sucked back mid-air.
- **No other absolute-positioned siblings inside `.burst-wrap`** — they'd steal the centered baseline.
- **❗ The burst IS the beat** — don't park a "real headline" label below it (the eye snaps to the label and ignores the burst). If a label is needed, reveal it post-burst in the same stack.
- Synced variant: identical duration + ease as the driver, or the chord falls apart.

## Selected motion rule: discrete-text-sequence

name: discrete-text-sequence
description: Replace entire text states at frame thresholds for non-linear typing effects — typos, bulk additions, pauses, backspaces, simulated thinking.
metadata:
  tags: text, typing, discrete, threshold, non-linear, sequence
---

# Discrete Text Sequence

Instead of character-by-character typewriter, replace entire string states at time thresholds — enabling non-linear effects (typos, backspaces, bulk paste, "thinking" gaps) that smooth per-char typing can't achieve. If your effect is "type each character, no edits", this rule is overkill — use the smooth-slice variation below.

## How It Works

The typing is authored as a sparse array of `{ t, text }` states; on every `onUpdate` a **reverse search** finds the latest entry whose `t` has passed and renders its text. Display jumps between states with no animation between them — the realism comes from the schedule shape: fast keystroke clusters (0.06–0.20s apart), pauses at word breaks (0.3–0.6s), a typo, backspaces peeling back to the fork, then a bulk paste replacing many chars in one entry. A block cursor blinks via a deterministic sin square wave on the same timeline.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="prompt">$</div>
  <div class="text-wrap">
    <span class="text" id="text"></span><span class="cursor" id="cursor">_</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.terminal {
  font-family: {monoFont}; /* monospace required — proportional jitters even in a fixed box */
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  font-size: TERMINAL_FONT_SIZE;
}
.text-wrap {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  min-width: TEXT_WRAP_MIN_WIDTH; /* ≥ widest state — stops right-edge jitter */
  white-space: nowrap;
}
.cursor {
  display: inline-block; /* inline ignores width */
  width: CURSOR_WIDTH;
}
```

```js
// Each entry shows from its t until the NEXT entry's t.
// Shape: keystrokes → typo → backspace to the fork → bulk paste → completion mark.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0.0, text: "" },
  { t: T_K1, text: "{p1}" }, // first keystrokes (~3-5 chars, 0.1-0.2s apart)
  { t: T_K2, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_typo}" }, // continuation containing a typo
  { t: T_BS, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_partial}" }, // backspace(s) — peel back to the fork
  { t: T_BULK, text: "{fullCorrectedText}" }, // bulk paste — many chars in one jump
  { t: T_DONE, text: "{fullCorrectedText + ' ✓'}" }, // completion marker
];

// Reverse-search for the latest entry whose t has passed
function textAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i].text;
  }
  return "";
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = textAt(driver.t);
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Cursor blink — deterministic sin square wave, never a CSS animation
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Smooth character slice** (continuous typewriter — no pauses, no edits): faster to author but uniformly "machine-typed", missing the human realism:

```js
const fullText = "{fullPhrase}";
const len = { v: 0 };
tl.to(
  len,
  {
    v: fullText.length,
    duration: TYPE_DUR,
    ease: "power1.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = fullText.substring(0, Math.floor(len.v));
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

- **Thinking pause** — hold one state for `THINK_HOLD_DUR` (0.8–2.0s; under 0.5s reads as a stutter, not thought) simply by leaving a gap before the next entry's `t`.
- **State pulse on completion** — when the final state lands, `tl.to(".text", { scale: 1.03–1.08, duration: 0.15–0.3, yoyo: true, repeat: 1 }, T_DONE)`.
- **Per-state color shift** — in `onUpdate`, branch on `driver.t` vs the milestones: success color after `T_DONE`, dim mid-edit, normal while typing.

## Critical Constraints

- **Reverse-search the array each frame** — O(n) with small n (≤30 typical); don't index by frame, the sequence is sparse.
- **`min-width` on the text wrap is mandatory** — without it the right edge jitters as state length changes.
- **Discrete jumps must be INSTANT** — any transition on the text turns the jump into a smear and kills the "typing" feel.
- **Cursor blink is sin/sequence-driven on the timeline**, `display: inline-block`, monospace font, `white-space: nowrap` (wrapping mid-state breaks the illusion; trailing spaces must survive).
- **Discrete vs smooth** — use discrete only for non-linear states (typos, pauses, bulk paste); plain typing takes the smooth-slice variation.

## Selected motion rule: gsap-effects

# GSAP Effects for HyperFrames

Drop-in animation patterns. Snippets show mechanism only, inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core); assume `tl` exists.

- [Typewriter](#typewriter) — character-by-character reveal with optional cursor / backspace / word rotation
- [Audio Visualizer](#audio-visualizer) — pre-extract audio data, drive Canvas/DOM rendering from the timeline

## Typewriter

Requires GSAP's TextPlugin alongside the core script:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3.14.2/dist/TextPlugin.min.js"></script>
<script>
  gsap.registerPlugin(TextPlugin);
</script>
```

### Basic

```js
const text = "Hello, world!";
const cps = 10; // chars per second — see timing table
tl.to(
  "#typed-text",
  { text: { value: text }, duration: text.length / cps, ease: "none" },
  startTime,
);
```

### Blinking Cursor

Three rules: **one cursor visible at a time** (hide previous before showing next); **cursor must blink when idle** (after typing, during holds); **no gap between text and cursor** (elements flush in HTML).

```html
<span id="typed-text"></span><span id="cursor" class="cursor-blink">|</span>
```

```css
@keyframes blink {
  0%,
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
  }
  50% {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}
.cursor-blink {
  animation: blink 0.8s step-end infinite;
}
.cursor-solid {
  animation: none;
  opacity: 1;
}
.cursor-hide {
  animation: none;
  opacity: 0;
}
```

Pattern: blink → solid (typing starts) → type → blink (typing done):

```js
tl.call(() => cursor.classList.replace("cursor-blink", "cursor-solid"), [], startTime);
tl.to("#typed-text", { text: { value: text }, duration: dur, ease: "none" }, startTime);
tl.call(() => cursor.classList.replace("cursor-solid", "cursor-blink"), [], startTime + dur);
```

Multi-line handoff: hide previous cursor → blink new → brief pause (~0.5s) → solid when typing. Never go `hidden → solid` (skips the idle blink).

### Backspacing

TextPlugin removes from the front — wrong for backspace. Use manual substring removal:

```js
function backspace(tl, selector, word, startTime, cps) {
  const el = document.querySelector(selector);
  const interval = 1 / cps;
  for (let i = word.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    tl.call(
      () => (el.textContent = word.slice(0, i)),
      [],
      startTime + (word.length - i) * interval,
    );
  }
  return word.length * interval;
}
```

### Spacing With Static Text

A typewriter word next to static text (`<span>Ship something</span><span style="margin-left:14px"><span id="word"></span><span id="cursor">|</span></span>` in a baseline-aligned flex row): use `margin-left` on the wrapper span. Don't use flex `gap` (it spaces the cursor from the text) and don't put a trailing space in the static text (it collapses when the dynamic span is empty).

### Word Rotation

Type → hold → backspace → next word; cursor blinks during every idle moment:

```js
let offset = 0;
words.forEach((word, i) => {
  const typeDur = word.length / 10;
  // cursor: solid while typing, blink during holds (same call pattern as above)
  tl.to("#typed-text", { text: { value: word }, duration: typeDur, ease: "none" }, offset);
  offset += typeDur + 1.5; // hold
  if (i < words.length - 1) offset += backspace(tl, "#typed-text", word, offset, 20) + 0.3;
});
```

### Appending Words

Build a sentence word-by-word into the same element: keep an `accumulated` string, each step tweens `text: { value: accumulated + " " + word }` with `duration: newChars / cps`, then advances the offset.

### Timing Guide

| CPS   | Feel             | Good for                   |
| ----- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| 3-5   | Slow, deliberate | Dramatic reveals, suspense |
| 8-12  | Natural typing   | Dialogue, narration        |
| 15-20 | Fast, energetic  | Tech demos, code           |
| 30+   | Near-instant     | Filling long blocks        |

## Audio Visualizer

Pre-extract audio data, drive Canvas / DOM rendering from the timeline. **Do not use the Web Audio API at render time** — there's no playback during seek.

### Extract Audio Data

Bundled extractor (requires `ffmpeg` + Python `numpy`):

```bash
python skills/hyperframes-creative/scripts/extract-audio-data.py audio.mp3 -o audio-data.json
python skills/hyperframes-creative/scripts/extract-audio-data.py video.mp4 --fps 30 --bands 16 -o audio-data.json
```

Output: `{ "fps": 30, "totalFrames": 5415, "frames": [{ "time": 0.0, "rms": 0.42, "bands": [0.8, 0.6, 0.3] }] }` — `rms` (0-1) is overall loudness; `bands[]` (0-1) are frequency magnitudes, index 0 = bass, each band normalized independently.

### Loading (Synchronously)

Inline the JSON for small files (< ~500 KB), or sync XHR for large ones:

```js
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("GET", "audio-data.json", false); // synchronous — deliberate
xhr.send();
const AUDIO_DATA = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
```

**Do NOT use async `fetch()`** — HyperFrames reads `window.__timelines` synchronously after page load; building the timeline inside `.then()` means it isn't ready when capture starts.

### Driving the Timeline

Canvas 2D is the workhorse (bars, waveforms, circles, gradients) — one `tl.call` per frame:

```js
const ctx = document.getElementById("viz").getContext("2d");
for (let f = 0; f < AUDIO_DATA.totalFrames; f++) {
  tl.call(
    () => {
      const frame = AUDIO_DATA.frames[f];
      ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
      // draw using frame.rms and frame.bands
    },
    [],
    f / AUDIO_DATA.fps,
  );
}
```

WebGL / Three.js: HyperFrames patches `THREE.Clock` for deterministic time — update uniforms from audio data each frame. DOM elements: fine under ~20 elements, slower than Canvas beyond that.

### Smoothing

```js
let prev = null;
const smoothing = 0.25; // 0.1-0.2 snappy, 0.3-0.5 flowing
function smooth(f) {
  const raw = AUDIO_DATA.frames[f];
  if (!prev) prev = { rms: raw.rms, bands: [...raw.bands] };
  else {
    prev = {
      rms: prev.rms * smoothing + raw.rms * (1 - smoothing),
      bands: raw.bands.map((b, i) => prev.bands[i] * smoothing + b * (1 - smoothing)),
    };
  }
  return prev;
}
```

### Design Guide

- **Spatial mapping** — horizontal: bass left, treble right; vertical: bass bottom; circular: bass at 12 o'clock, wrap clockwise (mirror for a full circle).
- **Bass drives big moves** (scale, glow, position); **treble drives detail** (shimmer, flicker, edges); **RMS drives globals** (background brightness, overall energy).
- Pick 2-3 animated properties — more looks noisy. Keep minimums above zero so quiet sections still have life.
- **Band count**: 4 = background glow/pulse, 8 = bar charts, 16 = detailed EQ (default), 32 = dense radial layouts.
- **Layering**: stack canvases with `z-index` — a background layer driven by bass/rms under a foreground layer driven by individual bands gives depth without per-element complexity.

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

## Values

| token             | range                                   | notes                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.
